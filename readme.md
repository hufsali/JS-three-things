there are three practised things in this repository:
. alert to pop up. different places pop up turn by turn.
. document.getElementById("id").innerHtml=("the change") is to change specific id holder.
    .defer, works in getElementById i.e read full document and then get id to be changed.
    .sync is default
. document.write, works where to write JS anywhere in html. no pop up no change in by id.
4th is console.log (not practiced yet).
. introduction of variable and comment also in this
